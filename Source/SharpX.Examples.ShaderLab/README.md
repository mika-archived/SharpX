# SharpX.Examples.ShaderLab

This is an example and test project for the SharpX.ShaderLab plugin.
This includes Vertex, Fragment and Geometry shaders, and the compiled source code is actually used as a shader for my VRChat avatar.
Shaders written in these C# source codes can actually be compiled and output as multi-pass shaders.
