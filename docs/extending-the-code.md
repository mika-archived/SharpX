# Extending the Code

ShaderSharp provides pre-defined methods for many functions that can be used in Unity ShaderLab.
However, if more functions are added due to Unity updates, they will not be available to ShaderSharp.
For such cases, ShaderSharp allows you to import them as external functions by following the conventions below.

```csharp
[External]
[Include("UnityCG.cginc")]
public static partial class UnityCg
{
    [Function("SomeUnityFunction")]
    public static extern SlFloat4 SomeUnityFunction(SlFloat4 x);
}
```

All you need to do is the following two things:

- Attaching `ExternalAttribute` to the static (partial) class
- Declare a static **extern** method with `FunctionAttribute` has a name in HLSL

If you need to include an external file, you can indicate it by adding `IncludeAttribute`.
If you want to add many functions, you can use the C# compiler to generate them automatically.
Add `ShaderSharp.CodeGen` to your project as an Analyzer and define a class like the following:

```csharp
[AutoGenerated("/path/to/definitions.txt")]
public static partial class UnityCg {}
```

Also, for the path set in AutoGeneratedAttribute, add a file written with the DSL definition as follows:

```
#class UnityCg
#converter NoConverter
#include UnityCG.cginc

function SomeUnityFunction
{
    signatures
    {
        (x is vector implements float has 4 elements) => __input__
    }
}
```

This will automatically generate the same C# code as above.
For more information about the DSL syntax, see [About Function Generator](./function-generator.md) for more details.
